1- Like Barça, they have won four European Cups: The first three came back-to-back in their golden era from 1974 to 1976, when the side was masterminded by Franz Beckenbauer (who is now their honorary president). They added the fourth in 2001.

2- They are the most successful team in German football history: They have won 23 leagues, 15 cups, and are also one of the few clubs to have won all of the European Cup, Cup Winners Cup and UEFA Cup.

3- They play at the Allianz Arena (called the München Arena in European competitions): In the north of the Bavarian capital its capacity is 68,000. It was opened in 2005 as one of the venues for the World Cup held the year after. It is admired around the world for its ultra-modern structure. 

4- The fastest champion: Bayern have won this season’s Bundesliga in all-time record time. They clinched the trophy with six games to spare.  

5- Jupp Heynckes the manager: The 67 year old German coach has been in charge since 2011. He’s travelled the football world and likes his teams to play the ball. His contract ends at the end of the season and is not being renewed.

6- Absentees: Striker Tony Kroos and defender Holger Badstuber are both currently sidelined through injury, and forward Mario Mandzukic will miss the first leg through suspension. But Bayern have a big squad with plenty of strength in depth.

7- Recent editions of the Champions League: Since winning the title in 2001, they have reached, but lost, two further finals in 2010 and 2012. In 2011, they went out in the round of 16 and in 2009 in the quarter finals.

8- Last meeting in 2009: In that season it was precisely Barça who put them out. Pep Guardiola’s stormed to a spectacular 4-0 win in the first leg, so a 1-1 draw in Munich was more than enough to ensure qualification.

9- July 24 friendly with Barça: The two teams will be meeting very shortly after this semi final in an already arranged summer charity match. It’s being called the Uli Hoeness Cup after Bayern’s current president, and will be played in the Allianz Arena.

10- Pep Guardiola the next manager: On January 16, Bayern Munich announced that they had signed the former Barcelona boss, who starts work in June 2013. The Catalan won 14 out of a possible 19 titles at FCB between 2008 and 2012, and has been taking a sabbatical this season.
